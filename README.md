### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide e-commerce analytic solution on gender-related issues within Palmoria group organization and its regions, to analyze the company’s data and generate insights that the management team would need to address the gender pay gap and bring about gender equality.

### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis are the ‘Palmoria_data.csv and Palmoria_group_bonus_rules.excel” file, containing detailed information about the employees and bonus amount based on rating.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains information scraped from Palmoria group HR including: 
Employee; name, gender, department, salary, location, rating
Rating; very poor, poor, average, good and very good

### Tools
Power Business Intelligence
- Data cleaning, analysis and creating report.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the Palmoria Group HR data to answer key questions such as:
1.	What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments.
2.	Show insights on ratings based on gender.
3.	Analyze the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management. 
4.	A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
-	Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
-	Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.? Also visualize this by regions 
5.	What is the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees? 
-	What is the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)?
-	What is the amount to be paid out per region and company-wide?

Palmoria Group has over 69% of their staff below the minimum salary of $90,000, with very little margin between the Male and Female gender.

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis we recommend that there should be a total review of the salary across all regions regardless of the Gender and the rating shouldn’t be used as a benchmark for salary increment.
